Get-AzureADRole
------------------

**Synopsis**

Gets the members of one or all Azure AD role. Roles does not mean groups.

**Syntax**

::

  Get-AzureADRole -All
  
::

  Get-AzureADRole -Role '[RoleName]'
  
::

  Get-AzureADRole -Role '[RoleId]'

**Description**

Uses a Graph API call to list the role, roleid, members name, and if there's any application service principal members. Application Service Principals will show up as '$null', as it's a bug within the Graph API output. This property can be expanded to reveal the actual name, e.g. 
::
  
  $a = Get-AzureAdRoleMember; $a.Applicationmembers

Due to mismatch in documentation, role names my not be 100% accurate to what the API's backend has, e.g. Company Administrator is what the API uses, but it's displayed as Global Administrator. Because of this, using a Role ID is more accurate.

**Examples**

::

  Get-AzureADRole -All

::

  Get-AzureADRole -Role '4dda258a-4568-4579-abeb-07709e34e307'
